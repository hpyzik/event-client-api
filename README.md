# Event client API

## Motivation

As a Spring training I'm going to port part of API functionality that I'm working on in my job.

The main idea of this API is to be CRUD for entertainment events.

## Development

To build project `mvn package`

To run project `java -jar target/event-client-api-*.jar`

Check out Spring logs to find used port `Tomcat initialized with port (s): 8080 (http)`

## API documentation

Documentation available under path `/swagger-ui.html`
